# SYDI
SYDI report patched to make patch comparison work...

To use, add your computer name to the AllMyComputers.txt file in the Tools directory, then run "0_Sydi Wrapper.bat"

The resultant report will be dumped into the Output directory. Once you have multiple files in the Output directory, you can use "3_Sydi Overview.bat" and "4_Sydi User Audit.bat" to populate a spreadsheet to compare statistics about each machine.

Enjoy!
